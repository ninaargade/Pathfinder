This is a simulation in which the user selects a blank space (not marked with an "X") on the game board as an "END" point. The simulation will then displaythe shortest path between the "START" and "END" spaces.

This project utilizes graph techniques and algorithms, including breadth first search and Dijkstra's algorithm. HTML/CSS is used to implement the user interface and Javascript is used to handle the back-end. Interactions are achieved via DOM manipulation.
